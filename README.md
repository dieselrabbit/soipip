# Screenlogic Over IP in Python

Forked from forked from keithpjolley/soipip with the goal of turning into a Home Assistant integration

From keithpjolley/soipip:
The protocol and codes are documented fairly well here:
https://github.com/ceisenach/screenlogic_over_ip
This code is essentially a translation of https://github.com/parnic/node-screenlogic
into Python. It's not complete...
The goal is the funtionality of https://github.com/tagyoureit/nodejs-poolController
over IP instead of RS-485.
